### BetterTwitchControls — Controls

### Implemented

- **`c`**: Focus the chat input (only when you are *not* already typing in an input/textarea/contenteditable).
- **`Esc` (while chat is focused)**: Leave chat focus and focus the player controls (so player hotkeys work again).
- **`t` (while player controls are focused)**: Toggle Theatre Mode (clicks the Twitch theatre-mode button that’s labeled with `(alt+t)`).
- **`l` (while player controls are focused)**: Skip to Live (activates the “LIVE” control that appears after rewinding).
- **`ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` (while player controls are focused)**: Volume up/down (focuses the volume slider if needed, then increments/decrements it).
